              <p>
                For over 4+ years, Samarth Clinic has been dedicated to improving lives through advanced physiotherapy,
                rehabilitation, and patient-centered care. Our mission is to help individuals overcome pain, restore
                mobility, and regain independence through evidence-based treatments and compassionate support.
              </p>
              <p>
                Founded in 2022 by Dr. Prem Prakash, Samarth Clinic was established with a vision to provide high-quality
                physiotherapy, rehabilitation, and multidisciplinary therapy services in a welcoming and supportive
                environment. Since then, we have continuously evolved by integrating modern rehabilitation technologies,
                advanced pain management solutions, and personalized treatment approaches to support faster and long-term
                recovery.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Samarth Clinic is recognized for delivering specialized care in Physiotherapy, Pain Management,
                Orthopedic Rehabilitation, Neurological Rehabilitation, Sports Rehabilitation, Speech Therapy,
                Occupational Therapy, Pediatric Rehabilitation, and Advanced Rehabilitation Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our approach goes beyond symptom relief — we focus on identifying and treating the root cause of pain,
                movement limitations, and functional challenges, helping individuals improve mobility, independence, and
                overall quality of life.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe every person deserves personalized care. That&apos;s why every treatment plan is designed
                according to individual needs, recovery goals, and functional improvement.
